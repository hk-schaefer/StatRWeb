\



###  Specialization - 3 course series

This specialization course consists of 3 courses:

1. Introduction to Probability and Data with R\
2. Inferential Statistics\
3. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression\
\

Each course is ending with a project in R to demonstrate the skills gained.
\



### Projects

This website demonstrates three projects to statistical analysis with R:\
\


**Project 1:** Inferential Statistics\

- [A "Step-by-step" guide can be found in the ABOUT section](about1.html)\
- [The R codes can be found here](project1.html)\
\

**Project 2:** Linear Regression and Modeling 

- [A "Step-by-step" guide can be found in the ABOUT section](about2.html)\
- [The R codes can be found here](project2.html)\
\

**Project 3:** Logistic Regression and Modeling 

- [A "Step-by-step" guide can be found in the ABOUT section](about3.html)\
- [The R codes can be found here](project3.html)\
\

All steps are documented in R Markdown with the relevant R codes. executable R Markdown files are available on GitHub [Link](https://github.com/hk-schaefer/StatRWeb).\
